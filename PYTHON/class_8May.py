#class is a blueprint for creating objects
#class is a collection of objects
#class is a collection of methods
#class is a collection of attributes
# A class is not an executable unit to executes the member functions of class it is required to habing some instance.
# A class provides the facility of encalsulation where multiple data members and the functions are binded together and
# remanin hidden from the outside world.
# A class dose'nt space on the memory because it is not the executable unit. The memory space is occupied by the object of the class.
# A class is a user defined data type and it is created with class keyword.
# A class can be an extract class that dose'nt have any functional body that is known as abstract class.
# A class can be inherited by another class.



# Object
# An object is an instance of a class. An object is an instance of a class.
# We can create multiple objects of a class.
# An object represents a single class at a time while a single class can have multiple objects at a time.
# An object can access data and the functions of the class.
# An object is an executable unit for a class.
# The objects of the same class can execute any of the function present in the class.
# objects w'ont be inherited and they c'ant show polymorphism,encapsulation and abstraction.
# Objects can be created during runtime is known as real world object creation.



"""Polymorphism

There are four types of polymorphism in Python:
Run time polymorphism:
    It can be implemented with the concept of inheritance. In this we have Method Overriding.In method Overriding we have the spechial termination of the function in the child class.
Compile time polymorphism: 
    Method overloading:
    In method overloading, we can use same function name more than once however there are certain conditions:
    The data type of arguments should be different.
    The arguments should be in different order.
    The number of arguments should be different.
    The return type of the function must be different.

Inheritance:    
    Calls the properties of another class then the concept is known as inheritance.
    The class can provide the properties id known as parent class.
    The class which is getting the properties is known as child class.
    The inhheritance executed properly with the object of the child class 
    An object of parent class can work parallely without calling the proerties of the child class.

    There may be a possibility that the parent class and the child classes have the same name of function
    The child class function takes priority to execute and they override the funcitonality of parent class.

Absyraction:
    It is a property to hiding the data values and extraction can be done with the help of extract classes and the abstract functions.
    A class without function body is known as abstract class and the function without body is known as abstract function.
    Abstract functions are found in abstract classes.

    The exceptions are semantic errors and the efforts during run time 
    They are considered as logical errors and can be rectified with exception handling mechanism.
    The errors are type errors or the long syntax errors.
    These are considered as compile time errors,they should be rectified during the compilation of the program.
    but a program can executes in the prsence of the exceptions.
