    "3. Buffring:-  it is the optional argument that dispays the buffer setting for the file. buffer is the temporary line size of a file. If we don't want     to set any temporary size for the file than the value must be ZERO. For a normal text file size the buffer valeue must be ONE. For any other size we    can mention that number as the argument 3."
